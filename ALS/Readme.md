# Alternating least squares

one of the rainforest model

## als use for ai self train and make it can be train and use in real time

each layer have three step

Layer N

## normal forwarding step

each neuron output float point for next layer

## Evaluation

using each float point use fitness function output score

## selection

shorting the score, use first 30% of score and directly output float point to next layer

## mutation

other 70& randomly use different function to change the neuron,

1. Nothing
2. NewConnection or delete connection?
3. New Node(Neuron?) or delete if no connection?
4. Change Weight and Bias

if neuron no connection, delete the neuron

Layer N+1
